In this dataset, we provide three kinds of data.

IoT Malware binary hashes: The hash information (e.g., SHA-256) of malware binaries captured during our long-term observations.

Botnet infrastructure Attributions: IP addresses, domains, and ports of the malware download servers, loaders, and Command and Control (C&C) servers utilized in the attacks.

Extracted Analytical Session Data: The JSON datasets extracted from the Telnet sessions, which contain essential session-specific information, communication patterns, process execution sequences, and other relevant analytical traces.
